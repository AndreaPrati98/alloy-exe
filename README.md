# Alloy-exe
Here some exercise in Alloy.

I am kind of new about this language, probably these files are full of bugs and things that doesn't work properly. Hopefully, I will upload also some text about exercise, but keep in mind that it's possible to model *everyting*, that's why a good __.als__ would be enough, a proper text is not required.
